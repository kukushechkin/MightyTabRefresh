# MightyTabRefresh

[![Xcode build](https://github.com/kukushechkin/MightyTabRefresh/actions/workflows/xcode.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kukushechkin/MightyTabRefresh/actions/workflows/xcode.yml)

# What is this?

An app that will automatically reload specific web pages in Safari.

# Why?

Sometimes web services have aggressive activity tracking and force you to login every e.g. hour of inactivity on the page. If this is some internal resource like Jira this may be very inconvenient to go through 2fa several times per day.

# TODO:
* update settings on edit finish
* focus is switched to Safari on SettingsView preview (i.e. app restart)
